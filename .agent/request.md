Please create a full featured Rust client and server utilizing this project's text to speech.  Smooth, real-time speech audio should be streamed back to client, and can save to audio file.  They absolutely must utilize my NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 laptop GPU to the fullest ability.  Upgrade dependencies to latest compatible versions.  Use pixi, uv, etc. where appropriate.  Be sure to implement the voice cloning feature by default with `/home/grant/github/CosyVoice/asset/interstellar-tars-01-resemble-denoised.wav` as the reference voice.
