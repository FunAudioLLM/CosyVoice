I’m not hungry. That explains the blood. Listen. Last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion, so he could get past that dog. But he got bit, that's why he's limping. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of the vault. Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret. That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.  I never get mail.
